#Shmup Project

I wanted to create something with a mechanic that let me try something a little outside of the box. I decided to go with the time traveller who ricochets bullets because I think it allows for something a little different but also stays in the genre of shmup. I also really like the idea of a stylized game, so having something a little "Back to the Future"- esque is a little cool.
